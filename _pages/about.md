I'm Yiqi Jiang, currently a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, advised by Prof. [Mark Schinitzer](https://schnitzerlab.stanford.edu/) and Prof. [Scott Linderman](https://lindermanlab.github.io/). I obtained my Bachelor degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and a minor in Applied Mathematics in 2022 from Cornell University, where I worked with Prof. Peter Doerschuk on biomedical images processing. 

I am interested in the dynamics of neural activity within and across brain regions as they relate to motor control, reinforcement learning, and brain-machine interfaces. My approach involves computational analyses of large-scale neural activity patterns, and I am especially interested in bidirectional approaches that take neural dynamics as inspiration for improving machine learning and robotics, as well as using methods from these engineering fields toward understanding the brain.
