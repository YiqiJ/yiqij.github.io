I'm Yiqi Jiang, currently a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, advised by Prof. [Mark Schinitzer](https://schnitzerlab.stanford.edu/) and Prof. [Scott Linderman](https://lindermanlab.github.io/). I obtained my Bachelor degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and a minor in Applied Mathematics in 2022 from Cornell University, where I worked with Prof. [Peter Doerschuk](https://doerschuklab.bme.cornell.edu/people/peter-doerschuk/) on biomedical images processing. During the pandemic, I was study away at Tsinghua University, where I worked with Prof. [Yu Wang](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in the NICS-EFC lab.

I am interested in the dynamics of neural activity within and across brain regions as they relate to motor control, reinforcement learning, and brain-machine interfaces. My approach involves computational analyses of large-scale neural activity patterns, and I am especially interested in bidirectional approaches that take neural dynamics as inspiration for improving machine learning and robotics, as well as using methods from these engineering fields toward understanding the brain.

## Beyond Research
I have been practicing badminton since the age of 7. I am a **National First-Class Athlete** (China) and held the title of **Beijing Provincial Champion** in both Women's Singles and Doubles. During my undergraduate studies, I played as WD1 for the Cornell Badminton Club, winning the **National Collegiate Division 1A Championship**.

I am also a classically trained musician. As a **principal clarinetist**, I have performed at the **National Centre for the Performing Arts** (Beijing) and the **Lincoln Center** (New York).
